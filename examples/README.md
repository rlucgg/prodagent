# Examples

Every example runs **offline and deterministically**: the model is played by
`ScriptedLlm` from a script, so no API key and no spend. Run any of them from
the repository root:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/greeter.py
```

The table order is the suggested reading order; `graph_demo.py` and
`react_demo.py` are the two raw-kernel demos that precede the series.
Scenarios 01-13 run in the browser via `make play`
(see the [playground](../README.md#playground-one-command-every-business-scenario-in-the-browser));
the five demos not in the catalog (`graph_demo`, `react_demo`, `persistence`,
`retry_timeout`, `backpressure`) are mechanism demos whose point lands best
in a terminal.

| File | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|
| `graph_demo.py` | The raw kernel with no model at all: a diamond graph where the two middle nodes run concurrently in one wave — watch the Bus events to see how BSP supersteps advance. |
| `react_demo.py` | Hand-assembling a ReAct loop from kernel primitives: two nodes, a conditional edge, and one back edge. The kernel itself contains no ReAct pattern. |
| `greeter.py` | The smallest agent: one model + one tool — think once, call the tool, answer. |
| `trader.py` | Multi-round haggling with a read tool, a write tool behind an approval gate (first rejection feeds back into the model), and long-term memory injecting user preferences. |
| `deep_research.py` | Many search rounds without blowing the context window: five-level compaction as a replaceable strategy — mechanical shortening first, model-called summaries only at the summary levels. |
| `compliance_audit.py` | Two audit branches run in parallel and converge; the "freeze accounts" write really suspends for human approval (`wait_human`), and a denial only changes the action — no re-run of the checks. |
| `code_detective.py` | MCP tools normalized to ordinary tools at the boundary, and a debugging skill loaded from a `SKILL.md` on disk — fix, rerun, fix again until the tests go green. |
| `after_sales.py` | The supervisor pattern: a supervisor agent whose "tools" are other agents — dispatch a specialist, its answer comes back, dispatch the next, then decide. The risk specialist delegates further, growing a three-level delegation tree where every level runs the same loop. |
| `aiops.py` | Both multi-agent semantics in one workflow: parallel diagnosis via delegation (*call*), then a no-return-edge `go` hands off to the repair agent (*transfer*). |
| `handoff.py` | Pure *transfer* in two shapes, with no supervisor in the flow: a fixed handoff **chain** (triage → billing → risk → close, each specialist hands a summary on and never runs again) and a **swarm net** where peers can hand the case *back* (billing ↔ risk) before settling. Every next holder is a runtime `go` read from the specialist's own verdict; the static in-edges are gated on the handover fact, so a peer the case never reached is swept as a dead branch and an early settle terminates cleanly. |
| `write_review.py` | Generator–critic: a writer drafts, a critic reviews, and a conditional branch carries a failing review to a reviser for one rework pass; a passing one finalizes the draft itself — a conditional branch, not a loop, with agents in the nodes. |
| `orchestrator.py` | Orchestrator-worker: the graph has ONE reviewer node. A planner agent reads a live catalog tool and writes a numbered plan; each line becomes a `Send` that stamps out a template copy — all copies run concurrently in one wave, and the synth waits for every one (the template-predecessor rule; `join` is moot with one in-edge). Fan-out width is data, not graph shape — with a real model; the offline fixtures change together. |
| `blackboard.py` | Multi-round consensus: experts never call each other — each appends its opinion to one shared append channel; a `join="all"` moderator reads the board and, if not converged, `Goto.rejoin` re-arms everyone for another round. Opinions accumulate; nobody is overwritten. |
| `dating_chat.py` | The capstone verification scenario: two agents, one shared conversation, two context strategies. He hand-truncates his messages (`del messages[:-4]`) and forwards a raw tool dump; she runs seeded memory + five-level compaction. Her review check catches the trap and her summary still carries the allergy line; his truncated window has already lost it — the closing verdict states all three as booleans. |
| `persistence.py` | Checkpoints and the event log on disk: a **freshly built** Workflow (simulating a process restart) resumes from the exact suspension point. |
| `retry_timeout.py` | Per-node resilience: a `RetryPolicy` with exponential backoff plus a timeout — mechanism in the kernel, policy fully replaceable. |
| `backpressure.py` | Streaming from inside a node via `ctx.emit`; a bounded subscription with `block` vs `drop` overflow policies — the demo drops 6 of 8 frames, counted, while the main flow never stalls. |
