"""blob — storage for large bytes; artifacts point into it.

The event stream must stay small and uniform. When an agent produces a file (a
report, a spreadsheet, an image), the *bytes* go to a BlobStore and only a
*pointer* (filename/version/uri/mime/size) is recorded as an ARTIFACT_WRITTEN
event. Artifacts are therefore, just like state and trace, a projection of the
event stream:

    replay the pointer events  -> the artifact library (what files, which versions)
    call BlobStore.load(uri)   -> the bytes themselves

Three pieces:
- BlobStore: the port — save assigns the next version and uri, load fetches;
- InMemoryBlobStore: the zero-side-effect default (same spirit as the in-memory
  event log); a durable local-directory implementation lives in backends;
- artifacts_from_events / latest_artifacts / resolve_artifact: pure
  projections and lookups over the stream.

Versioning is the store's job (it is what actually holds the bytes): each save
of the same filename in a run gets the next number, derived as one past the
highest version *still present* — never a count, so deleting an intermediate
version can't make the next save overwrite a file that is there. The in-memory
and local stores share that one rule (next_version), so the two backends cannot
drift apart. The filename is reduced to its basename, so a name like ``../x``
can never address outside the run directory.
