"""body — the single composable interface, plus four built-in bodies.

In the kernel's eyes there is only one kind of "schedulable thing": an
executable that satisfies the NodeBody protocol, takes input and a
NodeContext, and returns an Outcome. So:

- a plain function (FnBody) is a body;
- one governed tool call (ToolBody) is a body;
- one fixed-prompt model call (LLMBody) is a body;
- activating a sub-agent / sub-plan (SubPlanBody) is also a body.

There is no separate "macro node vs micro agent" vocabulary, only bodies
nested inside bodies — multi-agent is simply some body recursively running
another graph.

An Outcome is what a body produces, split orthogonally into:
- value: a value for downstream nodes;
- state_delta: data folded into shared state via reducers;
- control: a Goto/Send command (None = follow static edges naturally);
- suspend: when set, request to be released and suspended at this point.
