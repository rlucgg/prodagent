"""scheduler — the kernel's single engine: repeatedly compute "who is ready
now" and advance wave by wave.

The main loop is deliberately short, because the earlier parts absorb the
complexity:

    while running:
        ready   = plan.ready(run)           # 1) along edges, who is ready this wave
        results = run ready concurrently    # 2) wave concurrency (bounded), no direct shared-state mutation
        barrier: fold deltas / apply commands  # 3) commit together at wave end (facts already durable)

Three key properties:
- the wave is a consistency boundary: while running, nodes only produce
  Outcomes and never write shared state directly; everything is folded by
  reducers at the barrier, so concurrent results are deterministic and the
  barrier is naturally a commit point;
- suspension is "letting go": when a node requests an Interrupt, the wave lets
  the other nodes finish, then parks as a whole (its facts are already durable
  in the log); on resume the parked nodes re-run with the external values fed
  back; failure keeps the same discipline — the wave settles, then the Run
  stops;
- multi-agent adds no new engine: SubPlanBody recursively runs a child Run via
  the activation port — still right here.
