"""agent — the user-facing facade: a pure *definition*, hosted at run time.

An Agent holds only a definition — name, model, instruction, tools and
sub_agents — and keeps no ledger of its own. When you run it, the Agent is
hosted by a Scheduler (the runtime), which owns the event log, the state and
artifact stores and the bus. Sub-agents are agents the model can call: when it
does, the sub-agent's plan runs on the *same* Scheduler (one shared ledger, one
trace tree) but with that sub-agent's own model and tools bound to the child Run.

    researcher = Agent("researcher", model=llm,
                       instruction="You are in charge of research", tools=[search])
    result = await researcher.run("Look up X for me")
    print(result.output)

- pass plain functions as tools and the JSON schema is inferred automatically;
- sub_agents are called and return results (agent-as-tool, call semantics);
- a no-return handoff is graph orchestration: in a Workflow treat agents as
  nodes and use go(target_agent, summary) with no edge back — no edge back
  means no return, and no dedicated handoff command is needed;
- context / memory are optional cross-cutting strategies; it runs without them.

One agent calling another is the kernel mechanism recursing on the same
Scheduler: identity (model/tools) belongs to each Agent, the ledger to the host.
See runtime.react, runtime.workflow and Agent.sub_agents for the assembled plans.
